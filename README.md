# Mastermind-coursework
Mastermind is a two-player code-breaking board game played between the ‘Code Master’ and the ‘Code Breaker’. The board has rows of 4 holes each, as well as different coloured pegs. Each peg can have one colour from a specific set of colours. The ‘Code Master’ creates a combination of pegs on the last row (that is hidden) which the ‘Code Breaker’ must guess. The decoding board has a shield at one end covering a row of four large holes for the Code Master’s code, and twelve (or ten, or eight, or six) additional rows which must be an even number and decided in advance containing four large holes for the Code Breaker's guess next to a set of four small holes for the Code Master’s reply. The ‘Code Breaker’ tries his guesses in each row that include an equal number of holes beside them where the Code Master replies. Using this reply, the ‘Code Breaker’ can determine how close he is to finding the code.

The ‘Code Master’ uses:
- black keys for when a correctly coloured peg is in the correct hole
- white keys for when a correctly colored peg is in an incorrect hole
- no key for an incorrectly coloured peg

Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or all rows of the decoding boards are full. There are different variations of the game: you can decide if you want duplicates of colours, how many colours and the length of the code.
